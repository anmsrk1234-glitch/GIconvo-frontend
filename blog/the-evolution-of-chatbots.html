    <h1>The Evolution of Chatbots: From ELIZA to GIconvo</h1>

    <p>Chatbots have come a long way — from basic rule-based programs to intelligent AI that understands context, emotion, and intent. What started as a simple computer experiment in the 1960s has now evolved into tools like <strong>GIconvo</strong>, where anyone can chat with AI freely and intelligently.</p>

    <p>Let’s take a journey through time to see how chatbots have transformed over the decades — and how we arrived at the world of conversational AI we know today.</p>

    <div class="timeline">
      <h2>1966 — ELIZA: The Birth of Chatbots</h2>
      <p>The story begins with <strong>ELIZA</strong>, created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. ELIZA mimicked a psychotherapist, responding to users’ statements with simple pattern-matching rules. While limited, it was the first program to make people feel like they were “talking” to a computer.</p>

      <h2>1990s — The Rise of Rule-Based Chatbots</h2>
      <p>Decades later, chatbots like <strong>ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity)</strong> emerged. Built with AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), ALICE used pre-set rules to respond to human inputs. It could answer questions — but only those it was programmed for.</p>

      <h2>2000s — Smarter Assistants Appear</h2>
      <p>With the boom of the internet, customer support bots started appearing on websites. They could handle basic FAQs but still couldn’t truly “understand” language. Then came early voice assistants like <strong>Siri</strong> and <strong>Cortana</strong>, introducing the world to spoken AI.</p>

      <h2>2010s — The Era of Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>This decade changed everything. Chatbots began using <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>. Instead of being programmed with fixed rules, they learned from data — improving with every interaction. Chatbots like <strong>Replika</strong> and <strong>Google Assistant</strong> blurred the line between human and machine conversation.</p>

      <h2>2020s — Generative AI and Conversational Intelligence</h2>
      <p>Now, we live in the era of <strong>Generative AI</strong>. Tools like ChatGPT and GIconvo use massive neural networks that can reason, summarize, and create. They don’t just repeat — they <em>think</em>, <em>understand</em>, and <em>respond</em> like humans.</p>

      <h2>2025 — GIconvo: The Next Step in Open AI Conversations</h2>
      <p>Enter <strong>GIconvo</strong> — built to make AI truly free and accessible to everyone. Unlike most platforms, GIconvo lets people chat, learn, and create without restrictions. Whether you’re a student, developer, or creator, GIconvo is your intelligent companion that adapts to your needs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Future: AI as a Partner, Not Just a Tool</h2>
    <p>From ELIZA’s simple responses to GIconvo’s adaptive intelligence, chatbots have become more than programs — they’ve become partners in learning, creativity, and exploration. The next frontier is personalization — AI that knows you, grows with you, and helps you think bigger.</p>
